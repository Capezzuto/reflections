1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I suppose if I were working on a project with remote partners and there were changes I wanted to make available immediately to everyone involved, then making a commit on a remote repository would make sense.
2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? 
If there are changes that are not tested, or if one person in a collaborative project uploads new code, you might want the option to forego the new changes until more thorough testing.
Alternatively, you might want to attempt your own solution to a problem independently of the new changes on the remote.  
Or, maybe you want to wait until more commits are made on the remote, so that the new additions to the project are workable and bug-free.
